# Big O notation

Upper Bond of Asymptotic Notation => worse case scenario
Lower Bond of Asymptotic Notation => best case scenario

# Function growth slowest growing to fastest growing

constant
Logarimatic
Linear
Polynomial
Exponential


constant is lower bond of Omega(Logarimatic) => constant is best case scenario of logarimatic

Logarimatic is lower bond of Omega(Logarimatic) => Logarimatic is best case scenario of Log..
Logarimatic is upper bond of O(Logarimatic) => Logarimatic is worse case scenario of Log..
Logarimatic is tightly bond of Theta(Logarimatic) => Logarimatic is tightly both case scenario of Log..
